This will be my portfolio.

This branch `wireframe` will simply be the gray-box wireframing of the mobile version.

I will include two .html files.
  -index.html will be the loading file.
  -index2.html will be the second page.

  -The intent is that when you scroll down, the layout of the page changes, but is dynamically rendered. Because I'm only wireframing, I'm avoiding adding in all the javascript and simply making a separate .html page, but the current reload effect will be instead tied together by a smooth transition.
